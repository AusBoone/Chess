# Chess

The project is a simple implementation of a chess game in Java. It includes the following five files:

ChessBoard.java - This file contains the ChessBoard class which represents the chess board and the pieces on it. 
It includes methods for moving pieces, checking if the game is in check or checkmate state, handling pawn promotion, and more.

ChessBoard_Test.java - This file contains the test cases for the ChessBoard class. 
The test cases check the functionality of the methods in the ChessBoard class, making sure they work as expected.

ComputerPlayer.java - This file contains the ComputerPlayer class which represents the computer player in the game. 
It includes a method for the computer to make a move.

ComputerPlayer_Test.java - This file contains the test cases for the ComputerPlayer class. 
The test cases check the functionality of the method in the ComputerPlayer class, making sure it works as expected.

Main.java - This file contains the main method which runs the game. 
It creates a new ChessBoard object and starts the game loop.

The project is a good starting point for anyone looking to learn how to program a chess game in Java.
